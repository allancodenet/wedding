<p><strong>C. ONLINE ADVERTISING</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. Online Advertising Overview</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Services may integrate third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third parties, whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services, may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you as discussed above. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services. We sometimes provide our customer information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may “match” this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device you use to access the Services by such non-affiliated third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a></span>, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a></span>, or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your Online Choices</a></span> to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Ads Settings page</a></span>. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that if you exercise the opt out choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Services, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. Mobile Advertising</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When using mobile applications from KSP or others, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. We may use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications or for mobile application analytics. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements; thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements.</p>
<p>You may review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
