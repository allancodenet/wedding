<p><strong>2. The Services and Users of the Services</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through our Services we offer an innovative community and marketplace for the wedding industry, expectant parents, and for other important life events. Our Services are only available to business entities and individuals at least 18 years of age who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law.</p>
<p>Users of our Services include individual users such as prospective brides and grooms, newlyweds, wedding guests, people hosting an event, cohabitants of a residence, and expectant parents (collectively, “Members”), and companies and other third parties offering products and services related to weddings or other important life events (collectively, “Vendors”) (all of the foregoing, including Members and Vendors, are referred to collectively, herein as “Users”). Certain areas of the Services may provide a place for Members to interact with Vendors and book services that a Vendor offers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>a. Members</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Member, you acknowledge that while we use techniques to help verify the identity of Vendors when they register for memberships or subscriptions on our Services, we cannot and will not guarantee each Vendor’s identity, capabilities, that it has obtained all required permits, licenses or consents, or that it complies with all applicable laws. We do not endorse any particular Vendor nor do we guarantee the quality of their goods or services. You should use our Services as a starting point for identifying organizations that provide the products and services you need, then conduct your own research to ensure the service providers you choose to do business are appropriate for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>b. Vendors</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are agreeing to the Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to the Terms and, in such event, “you” and “your” refer to that company or other entity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Vendor you acknowledge that we will not endorse you or your products or services. We are in no way responsible for assisting you in reaching an agreement with Members. We are not responsible for assisting you in providing goods and services to Members. Your membership or subscription to our Services may not be transferred or sold to another party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Vendor you must list the true and correct name of your business on the Services. If there is a change to that business name, Vendors must promptly update the Services and may need to provide additional documentation for proof of name change. Vendors who engage in the sale of goods and services must have a valid business operations license, as applicable. If you or your company experiences a dissolution, merger or other significant change in personnel (e.g., sale of company), then we, in our sole discretion, have the right to determine whether to keep active, transfer or terminate your account, including all content previously associated with such account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may offer different types of paid and free memberships or subscriptions. For instance, we may offer “Basic,” “Free Trial,” “Lite,” or other unpaid vendor memberships. These unpaid Vendor memberships do not guarantee any advertising placement or other benefits. We reserve the right to modify the terms of or cancel any such unpaid vendor memberships. We may also offer memberships or subscriptions for which a Vendor pays (“Paid Subscriptions”). Additional terms and conditions described in the Terms of Purchase apply to such Paid Subscriptions, and are made a part of the Terms by reference. If there is a conflict between the Terms and the terms for any service offered on or through the Services, such as Paid Subscriptions, the latter terms shall control with respect to your use of that portion of the Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

You also agree to pay any attorney fees, and other costs of collection incurred by us with respect to any Unpaid Fees. You also consent and authorize us, in our sole discretion, to make appropriate reports to credit reporting agencies, financial institutions, tax agencies and law enforcement authorities, and cooperate with them in any resulting investigation or prosecution.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company agrees that it will not charge any late fees or interest to a User’s credit card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Correcting Mistakes in Payments to Vendors and Members</em>. We reserve the right to fix any processing errors we discover. We will correct any processing errors by debiting or crediting the payment method used for the erroneous refund or reimbursement. Users will look solely to other Users (including vendors) to resolve any payment errors made by such User, and we will have no liability for such errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Payment and Third-Party Payment Processors</em>. Purchases made through the Services (including for any User Provided Service) may be processed through a third-party payment processor or other payment service provider (each, a “Payment Processor”). If applicable, you may be provided a notice when entering your payment information directing you to such Payment Processor’s terms of use and privacy policy. All payments are governed by the Payment Processor’s terms of use and privacy policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Parties Relationship</em>. The applicable User, and not us, is responsible for delivering any purchased goods or providing any services. If you, as a User, choose to enter into a transaction with another User, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with such User and agree to any terms or conditions which may be imposed by such User. As a User, you acknowledge and agree that you, and not us, will be responsible for performing the obligations of such agreements, except as otherwise expressly set forth in the Terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Charges on Your Account</em>. You are responsible for all charges incurred under your account made by you or anyone who uses your account. If your payment method fails or you are past due on amounts owed, we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms. Your account may be deactivated without notice to you if payment is past due, regardless of the dollar amount. You are also responsible for paying any taxes imposed on your use of the Services or any services contained therein (including for any Vendor Provided Service), including, but not limited to, sales, use or value-added taxes. To the extent we are obligated to collect such taxes, the applicable tax will be added to your billing account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Authorization; Payment Processing</em>. You expressly authorize us to debit or credit any monies from the payment method you have chosen. Authorization to charge your chosen payment method account will remain in effect until you cancel or modify your preferences within the Services; provided, however, that such notice will not affect charges submitted before we could reasonably act. The Vendor shall be responsible for all fees associated with the processing of the payment method, including payment processing and associated bank fees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Automatic Membership Renewal (“Auto-Renew”)</em>. If you are a Vendor and you enter into a Terms of Purchase (TOP) / Terms of Sale (TOS) agreement with us, any terms in those TOP /TOS documents relating to automatic renewal or the explicit lack thereof, will prevail. Absent such terms, Vendor memberships may renew automatically for successive periods. Without limiting the foregoing, if you sign up, upgrade, or renew your membership, you are automatically entered into our auto-renew program unless otherwise specified in the applicable terms or agreement. This means that, unless otherwise specified in the applicable terms or agreement, we will charge your selected payment method at the start of each new membership term and during the membership term. To avoid having fees billed for the renewal term to your selected payment method, you must cancel your subscription before it renews as indicated in the applicable terms or agreement. You may cancel your membership by contacting us at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="mailto:support@weddingpro.com">support@weddingpro.com</a></span>. If you are enrolled in a monthly or other periodic payment plan and you decide to cancel during the membership period, you acknowledge and agree that, unless otherwise agreed in writing, you may continue to be billed on a monthly or other applicable periodic basis until your originally scheduled membership expiration date. Renewal pricing terms are subject to change, with notice, prior to the beginning of the next billing period.</p>

With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, you agree not to commence or prosecute any action in connection therewith other than in the state and federal courts of Maryland, and you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to, venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts of Maryland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>22. MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Binding Arbitration</em>. If we do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of sixty (60) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims (except as provided in the subsection entitled “Exception” below), as long as the party agrees with the terms set forth below.</p>
<p>Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Terms’ formation, performance, and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other, and/or your use of the Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with either (i) the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules, for claims that do not exceed $250,000; or (ii) the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, for claims exceeding $250,000. The JAMS rules and procedures just identified shall be those effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (not the Last Modified date of these Terms), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Arbitrator’s Powers</em>. The arbitrator (and not any federal, state, or local court or agency) shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms. Such disputes may include, but are not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, we will pay the additional cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, we will pay the fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing, unless you and we both agree to another location or telephonic arbitration. For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in Maryland, United States, and you and us agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Maryland in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Class Action Waiver</em>. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>
<p>This means that you and we expressly waive any rights to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</em>. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy, or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court with jurisdiction or in the KE. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights. “Intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets—but does not include privacy or publicity rights. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>30-Day Right to Opt Out</em>. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to at KSP  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="mailto:info@kenyaserviceproviders.com">info@kenyaserviceproviders.com</a></span>. Your written notice must have the subject line, “ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.” The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of (i) the Effective Date of these Terms; or (ii) your first date that you used the Services that contained any versions of the Terms that included this version of the Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver, whichever is later.</p>
<p>Otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with this section entitled “Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.” If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Changes to This Section</em>. We will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any material changes to this section by posting notice on the Services or informing you via email, and complying with any other applicable legal notice or consent requirements. Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Services or sent to you by email. Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection (“Changes to this Section”) is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection will be deemed to be severed from the section entitled “Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.” If this happens, the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section or similar section in existence after you began using the Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Survival</em>. This Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your use of the Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
